## 3.0 Points

The last assignment is worth 1800 points and you accumulate points by passing a series of autograder
tests.

## 4.0 Solo effort

:exclamation: You are prohibited from soliciting assistance or accepting assistance from any person
while taking the exam. The last assignment code that you submit _must_ be your own work. Likewise,
you are prohibited from assisting any other student required to take this exam. This includes those
taking  the exam during the regular exam period, as well as those who may take the exam at another
time and/or place due to scheduling conflicts or other issues.

## 5.0 Files

In line with the weekly lab exercises and problem sets you will be provided with a number of
files:

1. `swapi.md`: assignment instructions
2. `swapi.py`: script including a `main()` function and other definitions and statements
3. `sw_utils.py`: module containing utility functions and constants
4. One or more `*.csv` and/or `*.json` files that contain assignment data
5. One or more `fxt_*.json` test fixture files that you must match with the files you produce

Please download the assignment files from Canvas Files as soon as they are released. This is a timed
event and delays in acquiring the assignment files will shorten the time available to engage with
the challenges. The clock is not your friend.

:exclamation: _DO NOT_ modify or remove the scaffolded code that we provide in the Python script or
module files unless instructed to do so.

## 6.0 Data

The Star Wars saga has spawned films, animated series, books, music, artwork, toys, games, fandom
websites, cosplayers, scientific names for new organisms (e.g.,
[_Trigonopterus yoda_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonopterus_yoda)), and even a Darth Vader
_grotesque_ attached to the
[northwest tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader_grotesque#/media/File:Darth_vader_grotesque.jpg)
of the Washington National Cathedral.

The last assignment adds yet another Star Wars-inspired artifact to the list. The data used in this
assignment is sourced from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.py4e.com/) (SWAPI),
[Wookieepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page), and
[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).

Besides retrieving data from SWAPI you will also access information locally from the following data
files:

* `clone_wars.csv`
* `clone_wars_episodes.csv`
* `wookieepedia_droids.json`
* `wookieepedia_people.json`
* `wookieepedia_planets.csv`
* `wookieepedia_starships.csv`

## 7.0 The built-in `print()` function is your friend

:bulb: as you work through the challenges make frequent use of the built-in `print()` function to
check your variable assignments. Recall that you can call `print()` from inside a function, loop, or
conditional statement. Use f-strings and the newline escape character `\n` to better identify the
output that `print()` sends to the terminal as illustrated in the following example.

```python
print(f"\nSOME_VAL = {some_val}")
```

## 8.0 Challenges

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, there occured the Clone Wars (22-19 BBY), a major
conflict that pitted the [Galatic Republic](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Republic)
against the breakaway
[Separatist Alliance](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems). The
Republic fielded genetically modified human clone troopers commanded by members of the Jedi order
against Separtist battle droids. The struggle was waged across the galaxy and, in time, inspired an
animated television series entitled
[_Star Wars: The Clone Wars_](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars) which
debuted in October 2008 and ran for seven seasons (2008-2014, 2020).

__Challenge 01__ features a small _Clone Wars_ data set that provides general information about each
season. You will use it to demonstrate your indexing and slicing skills.

__Challenges 02-07__ utilize a second _Clone Wars_ data set that provides summary data about the
first forty-four (44) episodes that comprise seasons one and two. You will implement a number of
functions that will simplify interacting with the data in order to surface basic information about
the episodes and their directors, writers, and viewership.

__Challenges 08-14__ recreate the escape of the light freighter
[_Twilight_](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Twilight) from the sabotaged and doomed Separtist
heavy cruiser [_Malevolence_](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Malevolence) which took place
during the first year of the conflict (22 BBY). Your task is to reassemble the crew of the
_Twilight_ and take on passengers before disengaging from the _Malevolence_ and heading into deep
space. The Jedi generals [Anakin Skywalker](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker) and
[Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi) together with the astromech droid
[R2-D2](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/R2-D2) had earlier boarded the _Malevolence_
after maneuvering the much smaller _Twilight_ up against the heavy cruiser and
docking via an emergency air lock. Their mission was twofold: 1) retrieve the Republican Senator
Senator [Padm√© Amidala](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala) and the protocol droid
[C-3PO](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/C-3PO) whose ship had been seized after being caught in
the _Malevolence's_ tractor beam and 2) sabotage the warship.

In these challenges you will implement classes, methods, and functions before instantiating objects
and generating a JSON document that recreates the escape from the _Malevolence_.

May the Force be with You.

## 8.1 Challenge 01

__Task__: Utilize a small _Clone Wars_ data set to demonstrate your indexing and slicing skills.
Retrieve subsets of the data and individual values using indexing and slicing.

### 8.1.1 Get data

In `main` call the `read_csv` function and retrieve data contained in the file `clone_wars.csv`.
The file provides general information about _The Clone Wars_ animated series, seasons 1-7. Assign
the return value to a variable named `clone_wars`.

### 8.1.2 indexing and slicing

:exclamation: Using a `for` loop is neither required nor permitted. Also exclude _The Clone Wars_
"headers" list element when slicing the list.

1. In `main` employ slicing to access the subset of all _The Clone Wars_ seasons that feature
   twenty-two (22) episodes. Assign the list to a variable named `clone_wars_22`.

2. In `main` employ slicing to access the subset of _The Clone Wars_ seasons that either started or
   ended during the year 2012. Assign the list to a variable named `clone_wars_2012`.

3. In `main` employ indexing to access _The Clone Wars_ season URL string that _does not_ include
   the substring "\_Season\_" in it. Assign the string to a variable named `clone_wars_url`.

4. In `main` employ slicing to access all _The Clone Wars_ even-numbered seasons. Assign the list
   to a variable named `clone_wars_even_num_seasons`.

## 8.2 Challenge 02

__Task__: Explore the the first two seasons of _Clone Wars_ episodes. Implement a function that
checks whether or not an episode possesses viewership information.

### 8.2.1 Get data

In `main` call the `read_csv_to_dicts` function and retrieve data contained in the file
`clone_wars_episodes.csv`. The file provides information about the first forty-four (44) episodes
of _The Clone Wars_ (seasons 1-2). Assign the return value to a variable named
`clone_wars_episodes`.

:bulb: This challenge has you working with a list of nested dictionaries. Use the built-in
function `print()` to explore the nested dictionary or call the function `write_json` in `main`,
encode the data as JSON, and write it to a "test" JSON file so that you can view the list of
dictionaries more easily.

### 8.2.2 `has_viewer_data` function

Implement the function named `has_viewer_data`. The function computes the truth value of the
episode's "episode_us_viewers_mm" key-value pair, returning either `True` or `False`. Read the
function's Docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines,
and the return value it computes.

After implementing the function, return to `main`. Test your implementation of `has_viewer_data`
by counting the number of episodes in the `clone_wars_episodes` list that possess a
"episode_us_viewers_mm" value.

:bulb: Do this by implementing a `for` loop and a conditional statement inside the loop block that
tests the return value of the function `has_viewer_data` (returns either `True` or `False`).
If `True` increment the count by 1.

:exclamation: The number of episodes that possess a "episode_us_viewers_mm" viewership value
equals twenty-four (`24`). If your loop does not accumulate this value, recheck both your
implementation of `has_viewer_data` and your `for` loop and loop block `if` statement.

## 8.3 Challenge 03

__Task__: Implement the functions `convert_to_int`, `convert_to_float`, and `convert_to_list`. All
three functions attempt to convert a passed in value to a more appropriate type.

:exclamation: Each function in this challenge _must_ employ `try` and `except` statements in order
to handle runtime exceptions whenever an invalid type conversion is attempted. If a runtime
exception is encountered the `except` block will "catch" the exception and the value will be
returned to the caller unchanged.

:bulb: You do not need to specify a specific exception in the `except` statement. Simply return the
passed in value unchanged.

### 8.3.1 `convert_to_int` function

Implement the function named `convert_to_int` located in the module `swapi_utils.py`. The
function will attempt to convert a passed in value to an `int`. Read the function's Docstring to
better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it
computes.

### 8.3.2 `convert_to_float` function

Implement the function named `convert_to_float` located in the module `swapi_utils.py`. The
function will attempt to convert a passed in value to a `float`. Read the function's Docstring to
better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it
computes.

### 8.3.3 `convert_to_list` function

Implement the function named `convert_to_list` located in the module `swapi_utils.py`. The
function will attempt to convert a passed in value to a `list` using a provided `delimiter`.
Read the function's Docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it
defines, and the return value it computes.

:bulb: Model `convert_to_list` on the other type conversion functions. This challenge involves
adjusting your implementation per the hints below so that the function can handle converting
strings to lists or return the passed in value unchanged if an exception is encountered.

Note that the function's `delimiter` parameter defaults to `None`. You _must_
check the truth value of `delimiter` in the function block. If `True` pass the delimiter
value to the `str` method used to convert a string to a list; otherwise rely on the `str`
method's default behavior (i.e., don't pass it a delimiter argument).

:exclamation: Don't assume that the strings are "clean"; remove any leading/trailing spaces in
the passed in string before attempting to convert the value to a list.

### 8.3.4 Test the `convert_to_*` functions

After implementing the three functions return to `swapi.py`. In `main` test the functions by
calling each 2-3 times. Pass a value that can be converted and returned as a new type and a
couple of values that will trigger an exception and be returned unchanged. You can utilize the
built-in function `print()` to output each value to the terminal as illustrated by the following
example:

```python
print(f"\nconvert_to_int converted = {utl.convert_to_int('506')}")
print(f"\nconvert_to_int no change = {utl.convert_to_int('unknown')}")
print(f"\nconvert_to_int no change = {utl.convert_to_int([506, 507])}")
```

## 8.4 Challenge 04

__Task__: Implement a function that converts specified string values to more appropriate types.

### 8.4.1 `convert_episode_values` function

Implement the function named `convert_episode_values`. Read the function's Docstring to better
understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

The function accepts a list of nested "episode" dictionaries. In the function block implement a
nested loop with the outer loop iterating over the passed in `espisodes` and the inner loop
iterating over each episode's key-value pairs. Implement the necessary conditional logic to
convert the passed in dictionary values to the specified types, delegating to the `convert_*`
functions located in the module `swapi_utils` the task of converting strings to
either `int`, `float`, or `list` per the conversion chart below.

| Conversion | value(s) | Delegate to |
| :--------- | :------- | :---------- |
| `str` to `None` | All blank or empty values | handled locally |
| `str` to `int` | 'series_season_num', 'series_episode_num', 'season_episode_num' | swapi_utils.convert_to_int() |
| `str` to `float` | 'episode_prod_code', 'episode_us_viewers_mm' | swapi_utils.convert_to_float() |
| `str` to `list` | 'episode_writers' | swapi_utils.convert_to_list() |

After the outer loop terminate return the list of mutated dictionaries to the caller.

### 8.4.2 Call function; write to file

After implementing `convert_episode_values`, return to `main`. Call the function passing the
   `clone_wars_episodes` list as the argument. Assign the return value to `clone_wars_episodes`.

Then call the function `write_json` and pass the filepath `stu-clone_wars-episodes_converted.json`
and the converted list `clone_wars_episodes` to it as arguments. Compare your file to the test
fixture file `fxt-clone_wars-episodes_converted.json`. Both files _must_ match, line for
line, and character for character.

## 8.5 Challenge 05

__Task__: Implement functions to retrieve the most viewed / least viewed episodes of the first two
seasons of _The Clone Wars_.

### 8.5.1 `get_most_viewed_episode` function

Implement the function named `get_most_viewed_episode`. The function returns the episode from
the `episodes` list with the highest recorded viewership (ignores ties). Read the function's
Docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines,
and the return value it computes.

:bulb: Delegate to `has_viewer_data` the task of checking whether an episode contains a _truthy_
"episode_us_viewers_mm" value. You need to check if "episode_us_viewers_mm" has a value before
you compare the current "episode_us_viewers_mm" value to the previous value.

### 8.5.2 Call function

After implementing `get_most_viewed_episode` return to `main`. Call the function and pass
`clone_wars_episodes` to it as the argument. Assign the return value to `most_viewed_episode`.

:bulb: The episode with the highest recorded viewership is listed below. If this dictionary is
assigned to `most_viewed_episode` (confirm by passing it to `print()`) then proceed to the next
step; otherwise recheck your work.

```python
{
   'series_title': 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars',
   'series_season_num': 1,
   'series_episode_num': 2,
   'season_episode_num': 2,
   'episode_title': 'Rising Malevolence',
   'episode_director': 'Dave Filoni',
   'episode_writers': ['Steven Melching'],
   'episode_release_date': 'October 3, 2008',
   'episode_prod_code': 1.07,
   'episode_us_viewers_mm': 4.92
}
```

### 8.5.3 `get_least_viewed_episode` function

Implement the function named `get_least_viewed_episode`. The function returns the episode from
the `episodes` list with the lowest recorded viewership (ignores ties). Read the function's
Docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the
return value it computes.

:bulb: Delegate to `has_viewer_data` the task of checking whether an episode contains a _truthy_
"episode_us_viewers_mm" value. You need to check if "episode_us_viewers_mm" has a value before
you compare the current "episode_us_viewers_mm" value to the previous value.

### 8.5.4 Call function

After implementing `get_least_viewed_episode` return to `main`. Call the function and pass
`clone_wars_episodes` to it as the argument. Assign the return value to `least_viewed_episode`.

:bulb: The episode with the lowest recorded viewership is listed below. If this dictionary is
assigned to `least_viewed_episode` (confirm by passing it to `print()`) then proceed to the next
challenge; otherwise recheck your work.

```python
{
   'series_title': 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars',
   'series_season_num': 1,
   'series_episode_num': 9,
   'season_episode_num': 9,
   'episode_title': 'Cloak of Darkness',
   'episode_director': 'Dave Filoni',
   'episode_writers': ['Paul Dini'],
   'episode_release_date': 'December 5, 2008',
   'episode_prod_code': 1.1,
   'episode_us_viewers_mm': 1.95
}
```

## 8.6 Challenge 06

__Task__: Construct a dictionary of directors and a count of the number of episodes each directed
during the first two seasons of _The Clone Wars_.

### 8.6.1 `count_episodes_by_director` function

Implement the function named `count_episodes_by_director`. The function builds and returns a
dictionary of key-value pairs that associate each director in the `episodes` list of nested
dictionaries with a count of the episodes that they directed. Read the function's Docstring to
better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it
computes.

:exclamation: The director's name comprises the key and the associated value a count of the
number of episodes they directed. Implement conditional logic to ensure that each director
is assigned a key and the episode counts are properly tabulated and assigned as the value.

```python
{
   < director_name_01 >: < episode_count >,
   < director_name_02 >: < episode_count >,
   ...
}
```

### 8.6.2 Call function; write to file

After implementing `count_episodes_by_director` return to `main`. Call the function and pass
`clone_wars_episodes` to it as the argument. Assign the return value to `director_episode_counts`.

Then call the function `write_json` and pass the filepath
`stu-clone_wars-director_episode_counts.json` and `director_episode_counts` to it as arguments.

If your output matches the JSON object in `fxt-clone_wars-director_episode_counts.json` proceed to
the next challenge. Otherwise, recheck your work.

## 8.7 Challenge 07

__Task__: Construct a dictionary that groups the first forty-four (44) episodes of _The Clone Wars_
   by each contributing writer.

### 8.7.1 `group_episodes_by_writer` function

Implement the function named `group_episodes_by_writer`. The function builds and returns a
dictionary of key-value pairs that associates each writer to a list of episodes in which they
are credited with contributing to the screenplay. Read the function's Docstring to better
understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it
computes.

:exclamation: The writer's name comprises the key and the associated value a list of nested
episode dictionaries in which they are credited as a writer. Implement conditional logic to ensure
that each writer is assigned a key and the associated list value comprising one or more episode
dictionaries is constructed properly.

```python
{
   < writer_name_01 >: [{< episode_01 >}, {< episode_03 >}, ...],
   < writer_name_02 >: [{< episode_02 >}, {< episode_03 >}, ...],
   ...
}
```

:bulb: Consider implementing a nested loop in the function block in order to access all the
writers associated with an individual episode.

### 8.7.2 Call function; write to file

After implementing `group_episodes_by_writer` return to `main`. Call the function and pass
`clone_wars_episodes` to it as the argument. Assign the return value to `writer_episodes`.

Then call the function `write_json` and pass the filepath
`stu-clone_wars-writer_episodes.json` and `writer_episodes` to it as arguments. Compare your
file to the test fixture file `fxt-clone_wars-writer_episodes.json`. Both files _must_ match,
line for line, and character for character.

## 8.8 Challenge 08

__Task__: Implement the utility functions named `convert_to_none` and `convert_gravity_value`.

### 8.8.1 `convert_to_none` function

Implement the function named `convert_to_none` located in the module `swapi_utils.py`. The
function will attempt to convert a passed in string value to `None` if the value equals any
of the following strings:

* "n/a" or "N/A'
* "none" or "None"
* "unknown" or "Unknown"

The function _must_ return the value unchanged if the passed in value does not match any of the
strings above _or_ an exception is encountered.

Read the function's Docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it
defines, and the return value it computes.

:exclamation: The function _must_ employ `try` and `except` statements in order to handle runtime
exceptions whenever an invalid type conversion is attempted. If an exception is
encountered the `except` block will "catch" the exception and the value will be returned to the
caller unchanged.

### 8.8.2 Call function

After implementing `convert_to_none` return to `main`. Test your implementation by calling the
function several times from inside `print()` and passing to it test values such as "Unknown",
"Yoda", and the list `[1, 2, 3]`.

```python
print(f"\nChallenge 08: convert_to_none('Unknown') = {utl.convert_to_none('Unknown')}")
# returns None (converted)
print(f"\nChallenge 08: convert_to_none('Yoda') = {utl.convert_to_none('Yoda')}")
# returns 'Yoda' (no change)
print(f"\nChallenge 08: convert_to_none([1, 2, 3]) = {utl.convert_to_none([1, 2, 3])}")
# returns [1, 2, 3] (no change, exception caught)
```

### 8.8.3 `convert_gravity_value` function

Implement the function named `convert_gravity_value` located in the module `swapi_utils.py`. The
function will attempt to convert a planet's "gravity" value to a float by first removing the
"standard" unit of measure if it exists in the string. It then delegates to the function
`convert_to_float` the task of casting the value to a `float`.

The function _must_ return the value unchanged if the passed in value does not match any of the
strings above _or_ an exception is encountered.

Read the function's Docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it
defines, and the return value it computes.

:exclamation: The function _must_ employ `try` and `except` statements in order to handle runtime
exceptions whenever an invalid type conversion is attempted. If an exception is
encountered the `except` block will "catch" the exception and the value will be returned to the
caller unchanged.

### 8.8.4 Call function

After implementing `convert_gravity_value` return to `main`. Test your implementation by calling
the function from inside `print()` and passing to it different test values such as "1 standard",
"1.56", and the list `[1, 2, 3]`.

```python
print(f"\nChallenge 08: convert_gravity_value('1 standard') = {utl.convert_gravity_value('1 standard')}")
# returns 1.0 (converted)
print(f"\nChallenge 08: convert_gravity_value('1.56') = {utl.convert_gravity_value('1.56')}")
# returns 1.56 (converted)
print(f"\nChallenge 08: convert_gravity_value([1, 2, 3]) = {utl.convert_gravity_value([1, 2, 3])}")
# returns [1, 2, 3] (no change; exception caught)
```

## 8.9 Challenge 09

__Task__: Implement the `Planet` class and the function `create_planets()`. Review the associated
Docstrings for implementation details.

### 8.9.1 `Planet` class

`__init__`. Replace `pass` with the required and optional instance variable assignment
statements. Assign `None` to all optional instance variables.

:bulb: The values required to instantiate a class instance are specified in the `__init__` method's
parameter list.

`jsonable`. Replace `pass` and return a JSON-friendly dictionary comprising all instance
variables and their values expressed as key-value pairs in the order specified by the Docstring.
This is best accomplished by returning a dictionary literal.

### 8.9.2 `create_planet` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that instantiates an instance of `Planet`, assigns values to
optional instance variables sourced from the passed in `data` dictionary, and returns the new
`Planet` instance to the caller. Read the function's Docstring to better understand the task it
is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

Optional instance variables require special handling and are subject to the following type
conversion rules:

1. Convert all `data` string values to `None` that equal "n/a" or "N/A", "none" or "None" or
  "unknown" or "Unknown".

2. Convert other `data` values to `int`, `float` or `list` as specified in the table below.

   | `data` | `Droid` | Notes |
   | :----- | :------ | :---- |
   | region (`str`) | region (`str`) | No change |
   | sector (`str`) | sector (`str`) | No change |
   | suns (`str`) | suns (`int`) | |
   | moons (`str`) | moons (`int`) | |
   | orbital_period (`str`) | orbital_period_days (`float`) | |
   | diameter (`str`) | diameter_km (`int`) | |
   | gravity (`str`) | gravity_std (`float`) | |
   | climate (`str`) | climate (`list`) | |
   | terrain (`str`) | terrain (`list`) | |
   | population (`str`) | population (`int`) | |

   <br />

   :bulb: Leverage the `convert_*` functions in the `swapi-utils` module for effecting the type
   conversions.

### 8.9.3 Create planet Tatooine instance

After implementing `create_planet` return to `main`. Call the function `read_csv_to_dicts` and
retrieve the supplementary Wookieepedia planet data in the file `wookieepedia_planets.csv`. Assign
the return value to `wookiee_planets`.

Call the function `get_swapi_resource` and retrieve a SWAPI representation of the planet
[Tatooine](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine). Access the "Tatooine" dictionary which is
stored in the response object and assign the value to `tatooine_data`.

:bulb: The `swapi_utils` module includes a SWAPI "planets" URL constant that you can pass as the
`url` argument. If you need help constructing the `params` argument review the lecture notes and
code.

Next, access the "Tatooine" dictionary in `wookiee_planets` and update the `tatooine_data`
dictionary with the Wookieepedia Tatooine key-value pairs.

Call the function `create_planet()` and pass the updated `tatooine_data` to it as the argument.
Assign the return value (a `Planet` instance) to a variable named `tatooine`.

### 8.9.4 Write to file

Check your work. Call the function `write_json` and pass the filepath `stu-tatooine.json` and a
JSON-friendly representation of `tatooine` to it as the arguments. Compare your file to the test
fixture file `fxt-tatooine.json`. Both files _must_ match line for line and character for
character.

## 8.10 Challenge 10

__Task__: Implement the `Droid` class and the function `create_droids()`. Review the associated
Docstrings for implementation details.

:bulb: Challenge 09's workflow illustrates the general creational pattern applied to each planet,
person, droid, and starship encountered in Challenges 10-14.

* retrieve SWAPI data
* combine with Wookieepedia data
* create class instance
* assign (converted) values to object's optional instance variables
* write to file (i.e., check your work)

:exclamation: The SWAPI data will serve as the default representation of the entities that feature
in the assignment. The Wookieepedia data will be used to enrich the SWAPI data with new and updated
key-value pairs.

:exclamation: The starship _Twilight_ is sourced from Wookieepedia only. No SWAPI representation of
the light freighter exists.

### 8.10.1 `Droid` class

`__init__`. Replace `pass` with the required and optional instance variable assignment
statements. Assign `None` to all optional instance variables.

:bulb: The values required to instantiate a class instance are specified in the `__init__` method's
parameter list.

`jsonable`. Replace `pass` and return a JSON-friendly dictionary comprising all instance
variables and their values expressed as key-value pairs in the order specified by the Docstring.
This is best accomplished by returning a dictionary literal.

### 8.10.2 `create_droid` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that instantiates an instance of `Droid`, assigns values to
optional instance variables sourced from the passed in `data` dictionary, and returns the new
`Droid` instance to the caller. Read the function's Docstring to better understand the task it
is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

Optional instance variables require special handling and are subject to the
following type conversion rules:

1. Convert all `data` string values to `None` that equal "n/a" or "N/A", "none" or "None" or
   "unknown" or "Unknown".

2. Convert other `data` values to `int`, `float` or `list` as specified in the table below.

   | `data` | `Droid` | Notes |
   | :----- | :------ | :---- |
   | manufacturer (`str`) | manufacturer (`str`) | No change |
   | create-year (`str`) | create-year (`str`) | No change |
   | height (`str`) | height_m (`float`) | |
   | mass (`str`) | mass_kg (`float`) | |
   | equipment (`str`) | equipment (`list`) | Check delimiter in `wookieepedia_droids.json` |

   <br />

   :bulb: Leverage the `convert_*` functions in the `swapi-utils` module for effecting the type
   conversions.

### 8.10.3 Create R2-D2 `Droid` instance

After implementing the `Droid` class and the function `create_droid` return to `main`. Call the
function `read_json` and retrieve the supplementary Wookieepedia droid data in the file
`wookieepedia_droids.json`. Assign the return value to `wookiee_droids`.

Call the function `get_swapi_resource` and retrieve a SWAPI representation of the astromech droid
[R2-D2](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/R2-D2). Access the "R2-D2" dictionary which is stored in
the response object and assign the value to `r2_d2_data`.

:bulb: The `swapi_utils` module includes a SWAPI "people" URL constant that you can pass as the
`url` argument (Droids are considered people in SWAPI). If you need help constructing the
`params` argument review the lecture notes and code.

Access the "R2-D2" dictionary in `wookiee_droids` and update the `r2_d2_data` dictionary with the
Wookieepedia "R2-D2" key-value pairs.

Call the function `create_droid()` and pass the updated `r2_d2_data` to it as the argument.
Assign the return value (a `Droid` instance) to a variable named `r2_d2`.

### 8.10.4 Write to file

Check your work. Call the function `write_json` and pass the filepath `stu-r2_d2.json` and a
JSON-friendly representation of `r2_d2` to it as the arguments. Compare your file to the test
fixture file `fxt-r2_d2.json`. Both files _must_ match line for line and character for character.

## 8.11 Challenge 11

__Task__: Implement the `Person` class and the function `create_person()`. Review the associated
Docstrings for implementation details.

### 8.11.1 `Person` class

`__init__`. Replace `pass` with the required and optional instance variable assignment
statements. Assign `None` to all optional instance variables.

:bulb: The values required to instantiate a class instance are specified in the `__init__` method's
parameter list.

`jsonable`. Replace `pass` and return a JSON-friendly dictionary comprising all instance
variables and their values expressed as key-value pairs in the order specified by the Docstring.
This is best accomplished by returning a dictionary literal.

:exclamation: When implementing `Person.jsonable` recall that a `Person` instance's `self.homeworld` valure requires special handling in order to ensure
that the method returns a JSON-friendly representation of both the person and 
their home planet.

### 8.11.2 `create_person` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that instantiates an instance of `Person`, assigns values to
optional instance variables sourced from the passed in `data` dictionary, and returns the new
`Person` instance to the caller. Read the function's Docstring to better understand the task it
is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

Optional instance variables require special handling and are subject to the
following type conversion rules:

1. Convert all `data` string values to `None` that equal "n/a" or "N/A", "none" or "None" or
   "unknown" or "Unknown".

2. Convert other `data` values to `int`, `float` or `list` as specified in the table below.

   | `data` | `Person` | Notes |
   | :----- | :------ | :---- |
   | height (`str`) | height_m (`float`) | |
   | mass (`str`) | mass_kg (`float`) | |
   | homeworld (`str`) | homeworld (`Planet`) | Enriched with passed in Wookieepedia data |
   | force_sensitive ('bool') | force_sensitive ('bool') | No change |

   <br />

   :bulb: Leverage the `convert_*` functions in the `swapi-utils` module for effecting the
   type conversions.

3. :exclamation: Converting the `Planet` instance's `homeworld` attribute to an instance of
   `Planet` requires implementing the same "creational" workflow applied to other entities:

   * retrieve SWAPI planet data
   * combine with Wookieepedia data (sourced from passed in `planets` if argument is not `None`)
   * call `create_planet` and return class instance with converted instance variable values
   * assign new `Planet` instance to person object's `homeworld` instance variable

### 8.11.3 Create Anakin Skywalker `Person` instance

After implementing the `Person` class and the function `create_person` return to `main`. Call the
function `read_json` and retrieve the supplementary Wookieepedia person data in the file
`wookieepedia_people.json`. Assign the return value to `wookiee_people`.

Call the function `get_swapi_resource` and retrieve a SWAPI representation of the Jedi knight
[Anakin Skywalker](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker). Access the "Anakin"
dictionary which is stored in the response object and assign the value to `anakin_data`.

:bulb: The `swapi_utils` module includes a SWAPI "people" URL constant that you can pass as the
`url` argument. If you need help constructing the `params` argument review the lecture notes and
code.

Access the "Anakin" dictionary in `wookiee_people` and update the `anakin_data` dictionary
with the Wookieepedia "Anakin" key-value pairs.

Call the function `create_person()` and pass the updated `anakin_data` _and_ `wookiee_planets` as
arguments. Assign the return value (a `Person` instance) to a variable named `anakin`.

### 8.11.4 Write to file

Check your work. Call the function `write_json` and pass the filepath `stu-anakin_skywalker.json`
and a JSON-friendly representation of `anakin` to it as the arguments. Compare your file to the
test fixture file `fxt-anakin_skywalker.json`. Both files _must_ match line for line and
character for character.

## 8.12 Challenge 12

__Task__: Implement the `Starship` class and the function `create_starship()`. Review the associated
Docstrings for implementation details.

### 8.12.1 `Starship` class

`__init__`. Replace `pass` with the required and optional instance variable assignment
statements. Assign `None` to all optional instance variables.

:bulb: The values required to instantiate a class instance are specified in the `__init__` method's
parameter list. Note that neither `self.crew_members` nor `self.passengers_on_board` need to be
included in `__init__`. You will implement other methods tasked with adding crew members and
passengers.

`jsonable`. Replace `pass` and return a JSON-friendly dictionary comprising all instance
variables and their values expressed as key-value pairs in the order specified by the Docstring.
This is best accomplished by returning a dictionary literal.

:exclamation: A `Starship` instance can be assigned `Crew` and `Passengers` instances by
calling the `Starship.assign_crew_members` and `Starship.add_passengers` methods. As we've
discussed previously such objects require special handling when building and returning a
JSON-friendly representation of the `Starship`.

Be sure to include conditional logic in the `Starship.jsonable` method that checks if the
instance has the following attributes:

* `self.crew_members`
* `self.passengers_on_board`

If `True`, also check if the instance variable has been assigned a "truthy" value (e.g., not
`None`). If both conditions resolve to `True` then it should be safe to call the value's
`jsonable` method in order to return a dictionary representation of the object and assign it to
a local variable.

### 8.12.2 `create_starship` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that instantiates an instance of `Starship`, assigns values to
optional instance variables sourced from the passed in `data` dictionary, and returns the new
`Starship` instance to the caller. Read the function's Docstring to better understand the task
it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

Optional instance variables require special handling and are subject to the
following type conversion rules:

1. Convert all `data` string values to `None` that equal "n/a" or "N/A", "none" or "None" or
  "unknown" or "Unknown".

2. Convert other `data` values to `int`, `float` or `list` as specified in the table below.

   | `data` | `Starship` | Notes |
   | :----- | :------ | :---- |
   | manufacturer (`str`) | manufacturer (`str`) | No change |
   | length (`str`) | length_m (`float`) | |
   | max_atmosphering_speed (`str`) | max_atmosphering_speed (`int`) | |
   | hyperdrive_rating (`str`) | hyperdrive_rating (`float`) | |
   | MGLT (`str`) | MGLT (`int`) | |
   | armament (`str`) | armament (`list`) | check delimiter in `wookieepedia_starships.csv` |
   | cargo_capacity (`str`) | cargo_capacity_kg (`int`) | |
   | consumables (`str`) | consumables (`str`) | No change |

   <br />

   :bulb: Leverage the `convert_*` functions in the `swapi-utils` module for effecting the
   type conversions.

### 8.12.3 Create the light freighter Twilight `Starship` instance

After implementing the `starship` class and the function `create_starship` return to `main`.
Call the function `read_csv_to_dicts` and retrieve the supplementary Wookieepedia starship data
in the file `wookieepedia_starships.csv`. Assign the return value to `wookiee_starships`.

Access the light freigter named [_Twilight_](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Twilight) in
`wookiee_starships`. Assign the return value to a variable named `twilight_data`.

:bulb: There is no SWAPI representation of the light freighter _Twilight_.

Call the function `create_starship()` and pass `twilight_data` to it as the argument. Assign the
return value (a `Starship` instance) to a variable named `twilight`.

### 8.12.4 Write to file

Check your work. Call the function `write_json` and pass the filepath `stu-twilight.json`
and a JSON-friendly representation of `twilight` to it as the arguments. Compare your file to the
test fixture file `fxt-twilight.json`. Both files _must_ match line for line and character for
character.

## 8.13 Challenge 13

> Let's get back to the ship. Power up the engines R2. _Anakin Skywalker_

__Task__: Implement the `Starship.assign_crew_members` method. Assign Anakin Skywalker and
Obi-Wan Kenobi as the crew of the _Twilight_.

### 8.13.1 `Starship.assign_crew_members` method

Implement the `Starship.assign_crew_members` method. Read the function's Docstring to better
understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it
computes.

Add conditional logic to the method in order to ensure that the following restrictions apply:

1. The passed in `crew` argument _must_ be an instance of the `Crew` class.

If the condition is statisfied assign the passed in value to `self.crew_members`. If the condition
is violated _do not_ perform the variable assignment.

### 8.13.2 Assign a `Crew` instance to the _Twilight_

After implementing `Starship.assign_crew_members` return to `main`. Create a `Person` instance
that represents the Jedi General
[Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi). Utilize the same "creational"
workflow employed to create the Anakin Skywalker `Person` instance. Consider using the following
variable names to represent Obi-Wan.

* `obi_wan_data` (SWAPI and Wookieepedia dictionary data)
* `obi_wan` (`Person` instance)

Next, create a `Crew` instance assigning `anakin` as "pilot" and `obi_wan` as "copilot". Assign
the instance to a variable named `crew`.

:exclamation: The `Crew` class is fully implemented. Your task is to instantiate a new instance
and provide the `__init__` method with the required "crew members" object. Review the `Crew`
class's Docstrings as well as the lecture notes and solution files for more information and
hints.

Call the appropriate `Starship` method for adding crew members and assign the Anakin and Obi-Wan
`Crew` instance to the _Twilight_.

## 8.14 Challenge 14

__Task__: Implement the `Passengers` class. Assign Senator Padm√© Amidala, the protocol droid C-3PO,
and the astromech droid R2-D2 as passengers aboard the _Twilight_.

### 8.14.1 `Passengers` class

Implement the `Passengers` class by modeling its methods on the `Crew` class. The class
implementations are nearly identical. The key difference involves the type of object used to
instantiate an instance of each class.

`__init__`. accepts a __list__ of `Person` and/or `Droid` instances (the `Crew` class accepts a
dictionary). Note the difference and adjust the handling of the incoming object accordingly.

Unlike the `crew_members` dictionary in which each key is mapped to an instance variable, the
`passengers` list of `Person` and/or `Droid` instances requires employing dot notation to access
each `Person` or `Droid` instance's "name" value for use as a key. The two class's `jsonable`
methods also vary slightly. Read the relevant Docstrings for hints.

```python
crew = Crew({'some_role': < Person | Droid >, ...})

passengers = Passengers([< Person | Droid >, < Person | Droid >, ...])
```

:exclamation: When creating new `Passengers` instance variable names you must reformat the person
and droid name contained in the passed in list of passengers before passing the value to the
built-in function `setattr()`. Three rules apply:

1. Change name to lowercase
2. Replace space (' ') with underscore ('_')
3. Replace dash ('-') with underscore ('_')

`jsonable`. Replace `pass` and return a JSON-friendly dictionary comprising all instance
variables and their values expressed as key-value pairs. Mimic the `Crew` class's `jsonable`
method implementation but note that the method _must_ return a JSON-friendly __list__ of `Person`
and/or `Droid` instances. Call the appropriate `dict` method when looping over the `__dict__`
attribute to access each `Person` and/or `Droid` instance.

### 8.14.2 `Starship.add_passengers` method

Implement the `Starship.add_passengers` method. Read the function's Docstring to better
understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it
computes.

Add conditional logic to the method in order to ensure that the following restriction applies:

1. The passed in `passengers` argument _must_ be an instance of the `Passengers` class.

If the condition is statisfied assign the passed in value to `self.passengers_on_board`. If
the condition is violated _do not_ perform the variable assignment.

### 8.14.3 Assign a `Passengers` instance to the _Twilight_

> R2 are you quite certain that the ship is in this direction? This way looks potentially dangerous. _C-3PO_

After implementing `Starship.assign_crew_members` return to `main`. Create a `Person` instance
that represents the Galactic senator
[Padm√© Amidala](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala). Utilize the same
"creational" workflow employed to create the other `Person` instances. Consider using the following
variable names to represent Padm√©.

* `padme_data` (SWAPI and Wookieepedia dictionary data)
* `padme` (`Person` instance)

:bulb: The accented `√©` (e-acute) character in Padm√©'s name is replaced with `e` when the
Wookieepedia data is applied.

Create a `Droid` instance that represents the protocol droid named
[C-3PO](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/C-3PO). Utilize the same "creational" workflow employed to
create the R2-D2 `Droid` instances. Consider using the following variable names to represent C-3PO.

* `c_3po_data` (SWAPI and Wookieepedia dictionary data)
* `c_3po` (`Droid` instance)

Next, create a `Passengers` instance assigning `padme`, `c_3po`, and `r2_d2` (in that order) as
passengers. Assign the instance to a variable named `passengers`.

:bulb: Review the `Passengers` class `__init__` method to ensure that you pass the correct object
to the constructor.

Call `twilight.add_passengers` and assign the Padm√©, C-3PO, and R2-D2 `Passengers` instance to
the _Twilight_.

### 8.14.4 Write to file

Call the function `write_json` and pass the filepath `stu-twilight_departs.json` and a
JSON-friendly representation of `twilight` to it as the arguments. Compare your file to the
test fixture file `fxt-twilight_departs.json`. Both files _must_ match line for line and
character for character.

## 9.0 Finis

> R2 release the docking clamp. _Anakin Skywalker_

With our heroes on board the _Twilight_ and the engines fired, the light freighter detaches
itself from the stricken heavy cruiser _Malevolence_ and departs to rejoin the Republican fleet.

Your job is done. Never mind that Separtist starfighters are in hot pursuit of the _Twilight_.
Declare victory anyways.

Congratulations on completing SI 506.

## 10.0 Gradescope submissions

You may submit your solution to Gradescope as many times as needed before the expiration of
the exam time.

:exclamation: Your __final__ submission will constitute your exam submission.

## 11.0 Auto grader / manual scoring

The autograder runs a number of tests against the Python file you submit, which the autograder
imports as a module so that it can gain access to and inspect the functions and other objects
defined in your code. The functional tests are of two types:

1. The first type will call a function passing in known argument values and then perform an equality
   comparison between the return value and the expected return value. If the function's return value
   does not equal the expected return value the test will fail.

2. The second type of test involves checking variable assignments in `main()` or expressions in
   other functions. This type of test evaluates the code you write, character for character,
   against an expected line of code using a
   [regular expression](https://realpython.com/regex-python/) to account for permitted variations
   in the statements that you write. The test searches `main()` for the expected line of code. If
   the code is not located the test will fail.

If the auto grader is unable to grade your submission successfully with a score of 1800 points the
teaching team will grade your submission __manually__. Partial credit __may__ be awarded for
submissions that fail one or more autograder tests if the teaching team (at their sole discretion)
deem a score adjustment warranted.

If you submit a partial solution, feel free to include comments (if you have time) that explain
what you were attempting to accomplish in the area(s) of the program that are not working properly.
We will review your comments when determining partial credit.
